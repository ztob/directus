## Introduction

**Directus is a free and open-source data platform for headless content management**. It can be installed on top of any
new or existing SQL database, instantly providing a dynamic API (REST+GraphQL) and accompanying App for managing
content. Built entirely in TypeScript (in Node and Vue), Directus is completely modular and end-to-end extensible...
with absolutely no paywalls or artificial limitations.

Current database support includes: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MS-SQL Server, OracleDB, MariaDB, and variants such as AWS
Aurora/Redshift or Google Cloud Platform SQL.

## Installing

Directus requires NodeJS 10+. Create a new project with our simple CLI tool:

```
npm init directus-project my-project
```

Or using yarn:

```
yarn create directus-project my-project
```

The above command will create a directory with your project name, then walk you through the database configuration and
creation of your first admin user.
