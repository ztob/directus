# Directus Vue Components

Directus comes shipped with it's own Vue component library you can use to enrich your extensions, while making them fit
within the context of the Directus app.

These components can be used in any of the "front-end extensions", including [Interfaces](/guides/interfaces/),
[Displays](/guides/displays/), and [Modules](/guides/modules/).

::: warning Breaking Changes

While we aim to make the components as backwards compatible as possible, we **do not** consider internal-API changes in
the components as a breaking change of Directus. Please keep an eye
[the release notes](https://github.com/directus/directus/releases), and make sure your extension still works before
updating Directus.
