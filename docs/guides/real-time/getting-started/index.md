# Getting Started With Real-Time

Directus' WebSockets and GraphQL Subscription interfaces allow for real-time updates across clients. You can execute
CRUD operations, as well as subscribe to changes in a collection.

For most users, we recommend using WebSockets. If you already use GraphQL or want to explore it, then try out GraphQL
Subscriptions.
