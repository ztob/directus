# Layouts <small></small>

> Layouts determine how you view or interact with a Collection's Items. In most cases, they offer a way to browse items
> based on a specific type of data, but can also be used to interact with data.

Layouts provide different ways for presenting, browsing, visualizing, or even managing sets of data. Most commonly shown
on Collection Detail pages and contextual drawers for item selection. Directus includes several Layout options
