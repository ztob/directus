# Cloud Projects

> Cloud Projects are individual instances of Directus, managed within a Team. Professional and Enterprise tier Projects
> are available, with each offering different options for infrastructure, configuration and professional services. A
> Cloud Project is a Directus Instance, the [Infrastructure](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#infrastructure) it runs on, and
> all of its [data and file assets](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#asset-storage). All Cloud Projects include all
> [Cloud Exclusives](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#cloud-exclusives). See
> [Support Options](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#support-options) to find out how to get help on your Project.
