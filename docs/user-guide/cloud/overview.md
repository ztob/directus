[Directus Cloud](https://directus.cloud) is a hosting platform for
[Directus Projects](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#projects) which handles data storage, hosting, updates and scalability so
you can focus on building your digital apps and experiences. There are two
[tiers of Cloud Projects](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#projects): Professional and Enterprise. Both tiers come with all
the great features of Directus Core.

The Cloud Dashboard is constructed to manage three key components: [Accounts](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#accounts),
[Teams](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#teams) and [Projects](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#projects). First, create an Account.
Once logged in, create or join a Team, and your Account will become a Member of that Team. Once that's complete, you can
create Projects within a Team.

Accounts can be Members on multiple Teams. All Team Members have SuperAdmin privileges to manage the Team's Projects,
Project [billing](/user-guide/cloud/teams#manage-billing), other Team Members and the Team itself. Teams can have
multiple Team Members and multiple Projects. Projects can only be managed by one Team and cannot be transferred to new
Teams.

## Getting Started

To make life easy, you have the option to
[create and login to your free Cloud Account](/user-guide/cloud/accounts#create-account-and-login) automatically with
GitHub. If you don't have a GitHub account or prefer not to use this login method, email-and-password login is
available, as well. Once logged in, create a new Team or select an existing Team. Then you can access and manage the
Team's associated Projects, billing details, Team Members, Activity and Settings.

Remember: The Dashboard layout itself is designed to manage [Accounts](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#accounts),
[Teams](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#teams) and [Projects](/user-guide/cloud/glossary#projects). Here's how the Dashboard
