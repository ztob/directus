# Folders

> Folders provide the organization system for Files.

![Folders](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/app-guide/file-library/file-library-20220305A/folders-20220305A.webp)

They can be named, renamed, and nested as sub-folders anywhere in the Folder hierarchy. Once a Folder is selected from
the Navigation Bar, File Listing Page opens. The File Listing Page displays all Files within a Folder. It also enables
all other features and functionalities from the [Collections Page](/user-guide/content-module/content/collections) such
as batch editing, batch deleting, sorting, filtering, searching, etc. Folders can also be managed
[programmatically via the API](/reference/system/folders).
