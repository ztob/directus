## Dashboards Overview

![Dashboard Grid Area](https://cdn.directus.io/docs/v9/app-guide/insights/insights-20220216A/dashboards-overview-20220216A.webp)

Each Directus Dashboard provides a drag-and-drop canvas where you can create and arrange different Panels to easily
build out customized analytics. The Dashboard area automatically expands as you add more and more Panels. In theory, a
Dashboard area can expand infinitely large... but in practice, users will probably only want to build Dashboards as
large as the screen they will be viewing on. You are able to create as many Dashboards as you need. Additionally, the
Dashboard view, edit, and create permissions are
[fully configurable](/user-guide/user-management/users-roles-permissions) by User Role.

::: tip Auto Refresh

The Auto Refresh menu in the [Sidebar](/user-guide/overview/data-studio-app#_4-sidebar) lets you select an interval to
refresh dashboard data.
