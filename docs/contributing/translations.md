# Translating the App

> Directus is maintained by a global community of contributors who speak many different languages. For that reason, the
> App itself also supports multiple languages.

The Directus App has been translated into many different languages, and it's easy to add or improve the languages of
your choice.

::: tip Missing Context

If a translation string is missing enough context to understand its usage, Crowdin allows you to request additional
context.
