# Quickstart Guide

> This quickstart guide is designed to get you up and running with a Directus Project in a few minutes. Along the way,
> you will better understand what Directus is, setup your Directus project locally or with Directus Cloud, and get a
> hands-on introduction to the App and API.

## 1. Create a Project

::: tabs

== Directus Cloud

Create and login to your [Directus Cloud account](https://directus.cloud).

The very first time you log in to your Cloud Account, you will be prompted to create a Team. Each Directus Cloud Project
exists within the scope of one Team. They allow you to organize Team Members, Projects and Project Billing as desired.

Create a new project - once started, it should take around 90 seconds for the Cloud Project to created. During this
time, a link will be sent to the email associated with your Cloud Account. The email will contain your Project URL as
well as an email and password to login. If you used GitHub to create your account, this will be your GitHub email.

Login to your new project using the URL in your email inbox or on your Directus Cloud Dashboard.

_Learn more about Directus Cloud Projects in our [User Guide](/user-guide/cloud/projects)._

== Self-Hosted Installation

You will need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running on your machine.

Open up your terminal and run the following command:

```
docker run \
-p 8055:8055 \
-e KEY=replace-with-random-value \
-e SECRET=replace-with-random-value \
directus/directus
```

## 2. Create a Collection

Once logged in, you're greeted with the option to create your first
[Collection](/user-guide/overview/glossary#collections).

1. Navigate into the Content Module.
2. Click **"Create Collection"** and a side menu will appear.
3. Fill in a **Name**.\
   For the sake of this demo, we'll call ours `articles`, but feel free to make it your own!
4. Leave the other options at default. Click <span mi btn>arrow_forward</span> and the **"Optional System Fields"** menu
   will open.\
   Keep the values in this menu at the default, toggled off, for now. You can adjust them later.
5. Click <span mi btn>check</span> in the menu header.

## 3. Create a Field

With your first Collection created, it's time to start adding some [Fields](/user-guide/overview/glossary#fields).

1. Navigate to **Settings Module > Data Model > `Collection-Name`**.
2. Click the **"Create Field"** button and select the **"Input"** Field type.
3. Fill in a Field name under **Key**. We'll be calling our Field `title`.\
   Directus offers powerful Field customization options, but let's stick to the defaults for now.
4. Select **"Save"**.

## 4. Create an Item

Now that we have a Collection with a Field configured, it's time to add an [Item](/user-guide/overview/glossary#).

1. Navigate to the Content Module.
2. Click <span mi btn>add</span> in the page header to open the Item Page.
3. Fill in the Field Value(s) as desired.
4. Click <span mi btn>check</span> in the top-right to save your Item.

## 5. Set Roles & Permissions

Directus comes with two built-in roles: Public and Admin. The Public Role determines what data is returned to
non-authenticated users. Public comes with all permissions turned off and can be reconfigured with fully granular
control to expose exactly what you want unauthenticated Users to see. The Admin role has full permissions and this
cannot be changed. Aside from these built-in Roles, any number of new Roles can be created, all with fully customized,
granular permissions.

By Default, content entered into Directus will be considered private. So permissions always start off set to the default
of <span mi icon dngr>block</span> **No Access**, with full ability to reconfigure as desired. So, in order to have the
API return our Items, let's add some read permissions. For simplicity's sake, we'll do this on the Public Role, instead
of creating a new Role.

1. Navigate to **Settings Module > Roles & Permissions > Public**.
2. Click <span mi icon dngr>block</span> under the <span mi icon>visibility</span> icon on the desired Collection.\
   In our case, the Collection name is `articles`.
3. Click **"All Access"** to give the Public Role full read permissions to the Items in this Collection.

## 6. Connect to the API

Now that your Project has some content in it which is exposed to the Public, it's time to start using this content
externally! Data can be accessed in a number of ways, including the REST and GraphQL API endpoints. In this case, we'll
use the `/items/` [REST API endpoint](/reference/items) to retrieve the Item we just created.

1. Open `http://your-project-url.directus.app/items/articles` in your browser.

_And there it is! The Article Item you just created is being served in beautiful JSON, ready to be used anywhere and
everywhere!_

```json
{
	"data": [
		{
			"id": 1,
			"title": "Hello World!"
		}
	]
}
```

_In this example, we made a super-simple read request with the API, but there's more! The REST and GraphQL APIs provide
exhaustive endpoints for the data model and every single action that you can do in the App can be done via the API. In
fact, the App is just a GUI powered by the API._
